// This file represents a high-level view of the primary storage controller (PV
// binding, recycling, and provisioning).
//
// Design:
//
// The fundamental key to this design is the bi-directional "pointer" between
// PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), which is
// represented here as pvc.Spec.VolumePtr and pv.Spec.ClaimPtr (which are a
// little different in name than the actual Go structs).  The bi-directionality
// is complicated to manage in a transactionless system, but without it we
// can't ensure sane behavior in the face of different forms of trouble.  For
// example, a rogue HA controller instance could end up racing and making
// multiple bindings that are indistinguishable, resulting in potential data
// loss.
//
// This supports pre-bound (by the creator) objects in both directions: a PVC
// that wants a specific PV or a PV that is reserved for a specific PVC.
//
// Note: this controller is designed for active/passive HA.  We should
// document where things could break down in an active/active situation, but
// active/active is out of scope for now.

// This annotation applies to PVCs.  It indicates that the lifecycle of the PVC
// has passed through the initial setup.  This information changes how we
// interpret some observations of the state of the objects.
const annWasEverBound = "pv.kubernetes.io/bound-completed"

// This annotation applies to PVs and PVCs.  It indicates that the binding
// (PV->PVC or PVC->PV) was installed by the controller.  The absence of this
// annotation means the binding was done by the user (i.e. pre-bound).
const annBoundByController = "pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller"

// This annotation represents a new field which instructs dynamic provisioning
// to choose a particular storage class (aka profile).
const annClass = "volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class"

// This annotation is added to a PV that has been dynamically provisioned by
// Kubernetes. It's value is name of volume plugin that created the volume.
// It serves both user (to show where a PV comes from) and Kubernetes (to
// recognize dynamically provisioned PVs in its decissions).
